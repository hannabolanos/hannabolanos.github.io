			<p>Before he retired and moved to Florida, Robert Byczek liked to attend Chicago Bear’s games. Whenever the weather permitted it and prices were reasonable, you could find him sitting in the bleachers. If you accompanied Byczek for such an outing, at the end of the fourth quarter, he would ask you to wait with him until every last fan had gone. This is not due to intense fandom, but because he can’t move well in crowds. The small steps and quick directional changes required to navigate hordes of football fans (or anyone else for that matter) are at times impossible for Byczek. His wife Laura often serves as his personal linebacker&#8212a role she fulfills with force, not size&#8212clearing a path for Byczek to follow in. Leaving a sporting event, exiting an elevator, getting out of bed, these tiny transitional moments have been some of Byczek’s biggest challenges since he was diagnosed with Parkinson’s disease in 2012.</p>

	 		<p>Despite this, however, if you ask Byczek to take a lap around Soldier Field, the spry 62-year-old will gladly descend the stadium steps to the green grass below and begin striding, his six-foot-frame tall and sturdy. Every morning at 7 a.m., Byczek gets out of bed, shuffles to an exercise bike and rides for 10 minutes. Between personal training, boxing, swimming, weight training and biking, if it’s a day of the week, Byczek is moving. "Many people think when they get diagnosed that it’s a death sentence," he says. "Maybe I thought so too, for the first year, until I asked, what <i>can</i> I do?</p>

	 		<p>Consistent physical exercise can slow the progression of Parkinson’s disease and improve symptoms regardless of whether those afflicted take medication, but "the biggest issue is long-term compliance," says Dr. Cynthia Comella, a movement disorder specialist at Rush University Medical Center in Chicago. Everyone has made New Year's resolutions and let them fall to the wayside. Parkinson's sufferers are no exception. Facilities can be inaccessible due to location or personal handicaps. Many people simply lack motivation. Most importantly, exercise services are expensive. While physical and occupational therapy are covered by insurance, group exercise and personal training are not. Consequently, a readily available treatment for an incurable disease is going unused by too many.</p>

	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>--------</strong></p>

	 		<p>It’s an early Monday afternoon in February at the Edgewater Fitness Center, a neighborhood gym on the north side of Chicago. Four people are inside the main studio lifting weights and running on treadmills, but the real action is happening behind two closed doors to the right of the entrance.</p>

			<p>“Come on Boom Boom, I want to hear those punches!” That’s Eric Johnson, one of the trainers at Rock Steady Boxing, a national nonprofit organization that offers non-contact boxing programs for Parkinson's sufferers. This is the Windy City location, just one of 280 that span across 44 states. Every person here has a boxing nickname—Boom Boom, Big Bang, Pam the Pounder and Hurricane Harve are just a few. “One, two, one, two,” Johnson yells as his boxers connect large Everlast gloves to even larger punching bags hanging from the studio ceiling. All eight people in this particular class have advanced-stage Parkinson’s. Many have brought caretakers to assist them, some have trouble walking and punch with minimal fervor. But they’re all here, and at the very least, everyone’s smile muscles are working.</p>

			<p>“It’s a really amazing thing because everybody there is trying and wants to fight back,” says 62-year-old Susan Frenzel, an active Rock Steady member. “As long as you keep showing up, that’s half the battle.”</p>

			<p>Frenzel was diagnosed with Parkinson’s in July 2012, and she discovered Rock Steady in November 2015. Before she started exercising, the disease chipped away at her balance and dexterity. Tying her shoes is the hardest part of her day, so her husband often does it for her. After just over a year of boxing twice a week and taking two weekly aerobic classes, Frenzel’s tremors have improved, she walks faster and the exercise has cut her fatigue in half, at least, she says. “Not only is the exercise important, but the feeling of community and the support of the staff is invaluable,” Frenzel says.</p>

	 		<p>The ideal dosage and most effective type of exercise for those with Parkinson's remains unknown, but doctors like Daniel Corocs are hoping to find out within the next decade. Corcos is a movement neuroscientist and professor of physical therapy at Northwestern University’s Feinberg School of Medicine. He published a study in 2013 in Movement Disorders, the official journal of the International Parkinson and Movement Disorder Society, which concluded that progressive resistance exercise, like weight training, combats Parkinson’s symptoms more effectively than yoga or balance training. The reasons why aren’t entirely clear, but there is speculation. “When you are lifting large weights, we know that there is neuronal activity in those parts of the brain affected by Parkinson’s disease,” Dr. Corcos says. “You’re getting blood flow through parts of the brain [that] is very good for them.” When you do something like yoga or balance training, “There’s no evidence you’re engaging those parts to the same extent,” Dr. Corcos says. Additionally, being stronger in general is an effective defense against rigidity and muscle weakness, something most people with Parkinson’s suffer from—the bench press builds muscle faster than meditation does.</p> 

			<p>As of 2017, doctors have published over a decade’s worth of reputable research on the beneficial links between Parkinson’s and exercise. Many doctors recommended those with the disease take up boxing because it combines aerobics, strength building and balance work.</p> 

			<p> Eric Johnson remains unsatisfied. Not because Rock Steady isn't helping its clients. But because so few partake.</p>

	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>--------</strong></p>

			<p>As a certified Rock Steady trainer, Johnson also teaches boxing classes at his own studio, Movement Revolution, in the suburb of Deerfield, Ill. where Frenzel attends. Johnson started Movement Revolution in 2012 to offer group sessions and personal training for people with Parkinson’s and other neurological disorders. After graduating from the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh, Johnson worked at the Rehabilitation Institute of Chicago (RIC) for six years as an exercise physiologist developing workout programs for stroke survivors and Parkinson’s sufferers.</p> 

			<p>“I started Movement when I saw a need for services for people who couldn’t make it downtown,” Johnson says. Not only that, but he recognized the deterrence of personal training costs. “Through small and large group-based classes, I knew we could make it more affordable as well as create a sense of community,” he says.</p>

			<p>Parkinson’s manifests differently in everyone, which is why one-on-one training sessions are valuable, and their price reflects that. Frenzel switched from personal training to Rock Steady classes to save money and she knows many others who have done the same. Even so, cost remains an inhibitor to client commitment. An initial assessment for program eligibility at Rock Steady Windy City costs $65, though it includes gloves. After that, boxing twice a week costs $95 per month, $135 per month for three times a week and $150 per month for unlimited classes.</p>

			<p>“One of the biggest limiting factors for people that participate in our program is the financial burden,” Johnson says.“Our clients see improvements, and we’ve done case studies by collecting their outcome measurements to show what we’re doing is effective. In my eyes, there’s no reason why it shouldn’t be covered by insurance, especially because it’s preventative care.”</p>

			<p>To tackle this problem, Johnson teamed up with one of his long-term clients who has experienced the benefits of exercise for Parkinson’s first-hand: Robert Byczek.</p>


	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>--------</strong></p>

	 		<p>On January 9, 2017, Johnson, Byczek and two of Johnson’s business partners met downtown for lunch. Dressed in suits, the four made their way to Rush University Medical Center for a meeting. They entered a small room with two tables pushed together and all took a seat. Across from them sat Dr. Corcos, Dr. Comella and two other Rush clinical staff members. Johnson recalls it being intimidating until they started talking.</p>

			<p>Four years before this meeting in 2013, Johnson met Byczek at RIC and began working with him to target Byczek’s symptoms more directly. Johnson had started Movement Revolution just one year. It wasn’t until mid-2015 that they started talking business.</p>

			<p>Johnson confided in Byczek that he was looking to expand out of downtown and open his own studio. He began attending conferences and interviewing neurologists to determine the cardiovascular equipment he would need to have medical professionals refer their patients to him. The right kind of treadmill can cost upwards of $10,000. Luckily, Byczek, the founder of Legacy Capital Advisors—a provider of merger and acquisition advisory services in Chicago—was not new to business. When it became difficult to find donors for Johnson’s equipment, Byczek and two other investors filled the gap. “I only did it because I got to know Eric over a two-year period, and you have to make decisions about whether people are the wrong people or the right people,” Byczek says. “I thought Eric was a winner.”</p>

			<p>After Movement proved successful, the new business partners discussed the problem of insurance coverage. “Eric told me insurance companies really should pay for training [for Parkinson’s] because he’s confident that if they do, people could avoid accidents in the future, which would avoid high medical expenses,” says Byczek, who set up the meeting with Rush a few weeks later.</p>

			<p>The meeting was supposed to be short, but it ran a few hours over due to the sheer amount they had to talk about. They all agreed how beneficial exercise is for people with Parkinson’s and other movement disorders. When Johnson and Byczek suggested an expansion of insurance coverage for personal training and group exercise, the clinicians agreed it would be great—if it were possible. “Community-based exercise is not part of the American medical model,” says Dr. Christopher Goetz, director of the Movement Disorders Program at Rush University Medical Center. “You’re taking professionals, but not medically licensed professionals, and asking medical insurance to pay for their services. That’s a dream in the sky.”</p>

			<p>Physical therapy and occupational therapy are within the medical model, but they only help people with specific injuries for short periods. Once patients finish their treatments, they rarely keep up with their exercises. Programs like Rock Steady and personal training hold people accountable, but they fall outside of reimbursable services.</p>

			<p>“It’s a policy issue,” Dr. Goetz says. “If [insurance companies] open it up for this then they may have to open it up for other things. It’s a question of which professionals will be reimbursed.”</p>

			<p>Two months after the meeting with Rush, Byczek set up a conference call with a senior official of a large Illinois-based insurance company. Together, he, Johnson and Dr. Corcos put together a presentation and sent over a telephone book’s worth of research on the efficacy of exercise for movement disorder treatment, and the potential funds it could save insurance companies as a preventative care measure. The company is currently reviewing the documents and is expected to respond. “One thing I learned about Bob very quickly is he is not afraid to talk to anybody or stick his neck out no matter what the situation,” Johnson says. “It was Bob’s business connections that made it happen.”</p>

			<p>To make the argument for insurance coverage stronger, Dr. Goetz says compelling data on why people with movement disorders stop exercising—or never start—is necessary. “Knowing what dynamic leads people who have gotten better with the exercise to stop exercising may be their strongest argument, and we don’t know the answer to that,” Goetz says. It’s relatively easy data to get, but it would take grant money, and that is not always accessible. “All clinical studies, though we’d like to see them done today, take time,” Dr. Comella adds.</p>

			<p>Even if the insurance company is willing to expand coverage, it could be years before anything changes given the rigidity of the American medical system. Still, Johnson remains optimistic. He views this not only as an opportunity to help more people suffering from movement disorders, but a chance to change the face of personal training.</p>

			<p>“A lot of times personal trainers are looked at as meatheads or dumb jocks, and I think it’s a very serious profession,” Johnson says. “If you have the education and the background, you should try to help people that really need it. The goals of our clients are to walk through doors without freezing, to get in and out of their cars, to go to dinner without having it take 30 minutes to walk in. If we can help people do those things better, it’s more satisfying than helping people get bigger biceps and flatter abs.”</p>


			<p class="page-break"><strong>--------</strong></p>


			<p>Now that he’s retired, Byczek and his wife Laura spend most of their time in sunny Florida rather than in Chicago. Johnson and Dr. Corcos have taken over the insurance coverage initiative, but Byczek still sits in on phone calls and contributes business advice. “I’m always full of ideas,” he says.</p>

			<p>Though he can no longer train with Eric, Byczek has a new personal trainer in Florida, and Laura makes sure he exercises every day. Bike rides are much more pleasant year-round in their new home state. She is proud of the lead her husband has taken on trying to make a difference for other people with movement disorders, and she believes it is Byczek’s relentless positive attitude that has made all the difference for him.</p>

			<p>“He never sits down, and he is going to fight until the end,” Laura says. “He’s not happy he has [Parkinson’s], but we’re all going to have something at some point. It’s how you deal with it that makes the difference.”</p>
