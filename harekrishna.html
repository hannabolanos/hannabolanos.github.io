			<p>Every Sunday, hundreds of people come to the International Society of Krishna Consciousness temple in Rogers Park for Krishna Fest, a festival dedicated to spirituality. After an afternoon of dancing and chanting, the attendees line up in the temple's staircase to the fourth floor. They all stand patiently waiting to receive what they consider to be God's mercy&#8212food.</p>
	 		<p>Food offerings are not specific to temple activities; they are a large part of ISKCON's college outreach. Whether it's free food at student group meetings or meals provided by Krishna Lunch, students are eating up what Hare Krishna has to offer. But even though college kids can't resist free cuisine, there are more important reasons for why they join the movement.</p>
	 		<p>According to Krishni Metivier, a Northwestern alumna who wrote her senior thesis on Hare Krishna, the movement's college programs are the most successful part of its outreach. </p>
	 		<p>"Those programs tend to be successful because they're in a more open environment,"" Metivier said. "They put a lot of energy into them and that's the area they're trying to expand."</p>
	 		<p>One example of these programs is Bhakti yoga clubs, which exist at universities across the country, according to Nityananda Pran das, the ISKCON temple president. The clubs are student-run and typically meet weekly to eat and discuss spirituality. The ISKCON temple also runs a program called Krishna Lunch at the Illinois Institute of Technology, or IIT, and Northwestern University that sells $5 vegetarian meals on campus.</p> 
	 		<p>Metivier attributes students' attraction to Hare Krishna to the food and the clarity of its teachings.</p>
	 		<p>"Free food, I think that's a given, and beyond that students respect intelligence," Metivier said. "Hare Krishnas use logic and reason in their philosophy, and people are attracted to that. Especially college students."</p>

	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>Searching for answers</strong></p>

	 		<p>The logical philosophy can be especially intriguing to students who aren't satisfied with other religions.</p>
	 		<p>Avelo Roy, 27, was raised Hindu and lived in India before attending IIT. He discovered IIT's version of a Bhakti yoga club&#8212the Vedic Vision Society&#8212when he was 19. Roy said Hare Krishna answered many of his questions that Hinduism did not.</p>
	 		<p>"I was given logical explanations for everything. That was incredible to just have answers to why I'm doing what I'm doing,"" Roy said. "I was searching to find out, who is God, what is life's purpose and all these answers were given to me."</p>
	 		<p>Roy said he found the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita, an ancient Sanskrit text that Hare Krishna is founded on, most compelling.</p>
	 		<p>"It's life for dummies," Roy said. "For a twenty-year-old you can read the Bhagavad Gita and be like 'oh, this is how it all works,' and then you are as wise as someone much older than you."</p>
	 		<p>According to Metivier, college students are the ideal audience for religious groups because they are more open and exploring.</p>
	 		<p>Edward Suda, 28, was raised Catholic but said he considered himself agnostic growing up. Suda met Avelo Roy in 2007 at IIT. He said Roy would often bring him leftover food from Vedic Vision Society meetings, and eventually Suda decided to attend. </p>
	 		<p>"I felt bad about eating the food and not knowing whom I was getting it from, so I thought I should at least hear what they're about," Suda said.</p>
	 		<p>As an agnostic, Suda said he wasn't initially interested but kept going back because of the people.</p>
	 		<p>"The philosophy didn't quite jive with me because I wasn't very philosophically oriented," Suda said, "but the people clearly had integrity and sincerely wanted to practice what they were saying. My aversion to religion for once was overcome." </p>

	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>Only here to talk and eat</strong></p>

	 		<p>According to Metivier, students&#8212and people in general&#8212are attracted to Hare Krishnas because of the devotees' personalities. </p>
	 		<p>"They encourage people to speak up and think for themselves," Metivier said. "You can come just for the food or just for the music if you like. They're personable with everyone."</p>
	 		<p>Yarina Liston, a full time lecturer at Loyola University Chicago, advises the university's Bhakti Yoga Society. Every year for her Intro to Hinduism class, Liston said she takes her students to hear a talk at the ISKCON temple.</p>
	 		<p>"Students who have been drawn to the movement will say things like, 'they addressed issues that are important in my life and spirituality in a way that was welcoming and not dogmatic,'" Liston said. "[Students] feel they're allowed to discuss issues in a very rational, open way."</p>
	 		<p>Others are content to just enjoy the food.</p>
	 		<p>"[Hare Krishnas] seem interested in giving out food more than anything else," said Jack Cavanaugh, a Northwestern junior who said he buys Krishna Lunch about three times a week. "I like that it's driven up from the temple instead of from a restaurant in Evanston that is just trying to turn a profit."</p>
	 		<p>According to Rasika Manjari dasi, Krishna Lunch's head organizer, their aim is to give back to the community. </p>
	 		<p>"It's about sharing what we have," Manjari dasi said. "Yesterday we had one of our regular buyers say 'these are the real happy meals.' That's what we want, to share what we feel as part of love and happiness. For them it just may be food, but for us it's a lot more."</p>

	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>A way of life</strong></p>

	 		<p>Whatever reason students have for looking into Hare Krishna, some are so interested they choose to make it part of their lives.</p>
	 		<p>"I found a lot of happiness," Suda said. "It's a different quality of happiness than anything I've experienced before. It will never leave you."</p>
	 		<p>Even if fully accepting Hare Krishna took a long time, those who have committed themselves said it was worth it.</p>
	 		<p>"It took me 3 years to honestly accept it," Roy said. "It uprooted me from beliefs that I had, but then it strengthened me on a higher principle. We're not here for just feel factor, we're here for transformation."</p>
