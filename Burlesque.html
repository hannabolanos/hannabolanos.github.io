	 		<p>Dressed in a tight leather skirt, leopard print vest and bedazzled velvet blazer, a burlesque performer named Rosie Quartz stepped into the spotlight at Stage 773 in Chicago. Before a full house of 69 people, the 39-year-old, known by day as Rachel Feldhaus, executed a school teacher-inspired striptease. She pretended to touch herself while reading a book entitled "The Ethical Slut," her eyebrows raised suggestively. The audience cheered Rosie on as she stripped to the slinky guitar riffs of "Rumble" by Link Wray. She walked off stage in nothing but underwear and nipple pasties. She left her clothes on the floor.</p>
			<p>Feldhaus' act was part of a show put on by Vaudezilla Studios, a cabaret-style burlesque performance company based in Chicago. Feldhaus began taking classes at Vaudezilla for fun two-and-a-half years ago and immediately knew burlesque was for her. "I'm kind of curvier gal and it's made me feel very happy and positive about my body," Feldhaus says.</p>
			<p>Back in the 17th century, burlesque originated as comedic theater intended to mock plays. It became popular with males once stripping was incorporated, but faded out with the rise of Go-Go dancing and topless bars in the mid-20th century. Famous burlesque performer Dita Von Teese revived it in the '90s. Burlesque is now performed by people of all gender identities, but females specifically&#8212college-aged, middle-aged and beyond&#8212are participating as a route to confidence and empowering sexual expression. To them, burlesque is now for women, not for men.</p>
			<p>"It seems like a fertile environment for burlesque to have taken a hold,” says Veronica Arreola, the director of Women in Science and Engineering program at the University of Illinois at Chicago. She finds burlesque's rise in pop culture particularly interesting. "It's been around for a long time, but it's just now mainstream in a way that's not denigrating or disrespectful to women. It's been framed as highly empowering, fun and feminist."</p>

	 		<p>Two crystal chandeliers hang from Alaura Hernandez's living room ceiling. A bedazzled corset lies atop a folding beauty screen across the room from a white vintage piano accented with a Marie-Antoinette parlor wig. The apartment suits both Hernandez and her burlesque alter-ego, Diore DeLure.</p>
			<p>At six-feet-tall, the 22-year-old Hernandez, a blonde, dyes her hair Jessica Rabbit red, which complements her high cheekbones and bright blue eyes. Her debut burlesque performance was in Northwestern University's "Burlesque," which was created four years ago. She co-directed the show her sophomore, junior and senior year. She has performed professionally with Vaudezilla, and hopes to one day become a traveling showgirl.</p>
			<p>Though she was never formally diagnosed, Hernandez struggled with restrictive eating disorders growing up. The idea of stripping on stage her freshman year was terrifying, but she joined the troupe on a whim with a friend and fell in love. Hernandez now cites burlesque as her largest source of self-assurance.</p>	
			<p>"When I'm me, I don't usually feel very sexy. But when I'm Diore, in my makeup, in my corset, I'm a sex bomb, and I'm feeling myself," Hernandez says. "The confidence I've gained as Diore helps my confidence as Alaura."</p>
			<p>Historically, most burlesque performers were thin, white and busty. Today, particularly at Vaudezilla, that couldn't be farther from the truth.</p>
			<p>"Burlesque is intended to be a diverse group of ways bodies can be presented," says Red Hot Annie, the founder of Vaudezilla Studios. "It's very empowering to go on stage and to be accepted as you are."</p>
			<p>Annie, who prefers to go by her stage name, started performing burlesque in 2008, and founded Vaudezilla shortly after. The 33-year-old redhead emceed the student showcase and performed as its final act. Dressed in a bright teal overcoat with a long orange feather in her hair, she danced to the double entendre song "Long John Blues." Quick flicks of her arms and legs hit every jazzy note while her mouth, eyes and eyebrows told a suggestively comedic narrative—mostly sans-clothing, of course.</P>
			<p>Annie comes from a classical theater background, but formal training is not required to perform with Vaudezilla, or with many other companies.</p>
			<p>"People come in to see shows and to take classes because they want to get in touch with themselves," Annie says. "Burlesque is really special because you can come from any background whether it be stand-up, theater or you've never danced on stage at all, and you can potentially create artwork that is really inspiring to people."</p>

	 		<p>Despite its rising popularity, a number of vocal critics find burlesque objectifying and demeaning toward women.</p>
			<p>Meghan Murphy is the founder and editor of the Feminist Current, a Canadian feminist website and podcast. The 36-year-old writer, who has a master's in gender, sexuality and women's studies, critiques burlesque for its sexualization of all female body types.</p>
			<p>"There's this common argument that says if a woman chooses to do something, if she enjoys it, it can't possibly constitute objectification, which I disagree with," Murphy says. "I don't think every single burlesque performance is sexist and objectifying, but the exception doesn't make the rule."</p>
			<p>For Murphy, choice doesn't equate to feminism, an opinion performers like Annie do not share.<p/>
			<p>"I come from a type of feminism that is about choice," Annie says. "For me it really matters that the person on stage is making the choice to be there and the audience members are making the choice to be there. Some people may find that to not be empowering, but everyone has a right to their opinion."</p>
			<p>Murphy, however, takes umbrage with the fact that getting naked for an audience is a now a popular&#8212and arguably feminist&#8212act.</p>
			<p>"Why do [women] feel like we need to get empowerment through our naked bodies?" Murphy says. "I want women to find confidence and sense of self in other ways that are more long lasting and not based on feeling sexy."</p>
			<p>The debate extends beyond burlesque. Pop culture sensations like Nicki Minaj and Miley Cyrus bare it all and call it empowerment while others lament that their power&#8212or perhaps lack thereof&#8212still stems from a certain packaging of their sexuality. Daniel Loizzo, the president of Men Against Rape and Sexual Assault at Northwestern University, believes burlesque's sex-positive attitude is a good thing.</p>
			<p>"It's completely ok for men to walk around shirtless, but if women are showing too much they become a slut, or a stripper," Loizzo says. "That culture is one of the things I think burlesque is trying to break down."</p>

	 		<p>After intermission at Vaudezilla's showcase, a performer named Heart Crimson emerged in tight, red, floor-length dress. Heart Crimson, who is genderqueer and prefers the pronoun 'they,' smiled flirtatiously at viewers to the classic burlesque song "The Stripper." One minute into the routine, the theme song of Jack Nicholson's film "The Shining" changed the mood. Heart Crimson froze, began to shake and stared straight ahead in silence. The 21-year-old Filipino performer stripped to a rendition of "You're Driving Me Crazy," a naked back scathed by fake burns made of makeup turned toward the audience. At last, Heart Crimson swiveled around to reveal the phrase "White Man's Burden" written across their chest.</p>
			<p>Heart Crimson's dress looked intentionally similar to the carpeting in the Overlook Hotel from "The Shining." The removal of the gown represented the breakdown of the hotel, a symbol of American colonialism and wealth built atop Native American burial grounds in the film. Given the reveal of the phrase "White Man's Burden" and Heart Crimson's race, the performer says those who have not seen "The Shining" often read the piece as a comment on orientalism.</p> 
			<p>"It wasn't intended to be a piece about orientalism specifically,"" says Heart Crimson, who prefers to be referred to by stage name. "But I feel really blessed that it works on that level, and because it has that extra layer, it is more impactful."</p>
			<p>Burlesque acts like Heart Crimson's place more emphasis on artistic messages than just on stripping. In Murphy's opinion, however, such pieces are more similar to performance art than to burlesque. Even if burlesque moves away from the classic striptease, she doesn't believe it will erase its historically sexist origins.</p>
			<p>"I don't know what the obsession is with trying to make sexist, oppressive things our own," Murphy says of women. "If what you're doing is something else entirely, why fit it within the burlesque category? It can feel productive to try and subvert these things, but I don't think it's going to change burlesque and what it means."</p>
			<p>Regardless, many performers believe burlesque create change.</p>
			<p>"Some people are getting into it to empower themselves, to put messages out there, or just for funsies," Annie says. "Nowadays, a lot of the things people are talking about have to do with the right of people to fall outside of 'normal' or 'commercial.' I think burlesque is reflective of that. I would classify it as a social movement."</p>
			<p>A social movement led by women.</p>
			<p>"I feel like we're in this beautiful moment when [women] are taking society and pushing us into this new space," Veronica Arreola says. "Any big change like that is uncomfortable, but at the end of this transition, I think we will be in a happier place."</p>
