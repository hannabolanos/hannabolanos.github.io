	 		<p>Dressed in a navy pantsuit, red tie and an unconvincing yellow wig, a burlesque performer named Po’Chop stepped onstage at the Conspiratorium theater in downtown Chicago and channeled her best Donald Trump. The 31-year-old performer saluted, high-kicked and shimmied to an original mix of Trump quotes and “Freedom’s Call,” a patriotic tune sung by three young girls at one of the nominee’s rallies in January. “I’m very rich,” Mr. Trump’s voice boomed as Po’Chop pretended to pull Monopoly money out of her rear. “I would build a great wall, nobody builds walls better than me, believe me,” he declared as confetti flew and she snapped an American flag in half across her exposed thigh. The small audience of 24 roared as Po’Chop smiled big league and stripped down to a star-spangled bikini. When she finally bounced off stage, her loyal constituents were still cheering.</p>

			<p>Long before the release of a 2005 “Access Hollywood” recording in which Donald Trump brags about grabbing women by the genitals to Billy Bush, sexist rhetoric decorated the Republican nominee’s campaign. With Election Day approaching fast, women from all across the political spectrum are denouncing Mr. Trump, and one group is getting particularly creative&#8212burlesque performers.</p>

			<p>Burlesque originated in the 19th century as comedic theater intended to mock plays and politics. It became popular with males once stripping was incorporated, but faded out with the rise of Go-Go dancing and topless bars in the mid-20th century. Since the 1990s, the “neo-burlesque” movement has gained popularity among females of all ages. For them, burlesque is a route to confidence and empowering sexual expression. Taking Trump down along the way has become a popular side-gig.</p>


	 		<p class="page-break"><strong>------</strong></p>

	 		<p>Jenn Freeman was a dancer long before it became her focus at Colombia College Chicago. Seven years ago, she created the avant-garde, genre-pushing character of Po’Chop. As a black female burlesque performer, Freeman says her work is inherently political, but it became so in a more literal way this past January after she saw three young girls sing “Freedom’s Call” at a Trump rally. Her routine “Sexy Freedom Fighter,” which she recently performed on the Conspiratorium stage, strives to capture the laughable horror of Mr. Trump’s candidacy.</p>

			<p>“I try to embody dance team, meets classic burlesque, meets Trump,” Freeman says. “It’s heavy-handed satire to the point that when some people see it they think I’m serious. It’s a pure spectacle mess.”</p>

			<p>Jeff Popick, a 54-year-old real estate developer from Florida, wrote lyrics for “Freedom’s Call” to the tune of “Over There,” a ballad from World War I. As soon as Freeman heard the catchy, robotic melody, she was inspired. Her routine “Sexy Freedom Fighter” is predominately satire, but Freeman says it also has feminist implications when performed as a burlesque piece.</p>

			<p>“This election inspires me to continue creating work that directly talks about femininity and women’s bodies,” she says. “I also think [the act] reinforces what my work is already trying to say. It’s pretty easy to do a Trump piece and make a statement as a woman.”</p>

			<p>Freeman’s recent performance at the Conspiratorium was part of a show entitled "The Resistible Rise of Herr Helmut Drumpf," a creation of new Chicago theater group, the Conspirators. The play is based on "The Resistible Rise of Arturo Ui," a satire of Hitler’s rise to power, by Bertolt Brecht. Freeman reached out to Director and Co-creator William Bullion when she heard he was looking for people to perform between scenes, and he immediately accepted.</p>

			<p>The show demonizes those who stood aside and facilitated Mr. Trump’s rise through a crazed version of Commedia dell’Arte that the Conspirators call “The Style.” While Mr. Trump’s mistreatment of women isn’t a main focus of the play, Bullion says Freeman’s burlesque act fit in well.</p>

	 		<p>“The coincidence is that part of our fight against Trump is to seize control of the narrative ourselves and be strong in what we’re doing,” Bullion says. “A feminist burlesque performer takes control of her own body, and it’s a thumb in the face to people like Trump and their opinions of gender roles.”</p>

			<p>Political burlesque is really nothing new. Before stripping became the main event, the art form was meant to poke fun at politics and current events. Its current resurgence is "history repeats itself" personified with little to no clothing.</p>

			<p>Diore DeLure, a Chicago-based burlesque performer, has seen at least four burlesque shows mocking Mr. Trump in Chicago this year. One put on in September by the Better Boobie Bureau was called “Make America Sexy Again.” In the midst of this election season, DeLure finds the burlesque community to be a comfort.<p/>

			<p>“Women are finding an outlet in which to express themselves that doesn’t make them conform to society’s expectations of what a woman should look like,” DeLure says. “It’s interesting how that liberation is happening while we have a candidate like Donald Trump basically trying to stamp out freedom to be a woman in whatever way, shape, or form you present yourself. It’s encouraging to be in such a positive space that recognizes the damage he is doing.”</p>

			<p>To others, however, burlesque is an ineffective and hypocritical way to fight a sexist dialogue. Meghan Murphy is the founder and editor of the Feminist Current, a Canadian feminist website and podcast. The 36-year-old writer&#8212who has a master’s in gender, sexuality and women’s studies&#8212believes burlesque perpetuates everything it claims to fight against.</p>

			<p>“Trump is a misogynist, and he sees women as things that exist for him to look at, comment on, to grope,” Murphy says. “[Burlesque] reinforces the idea that women are pretty sexy objects to be put on display and titillate an audience. Whether or not those women are choosing to do it doesn’t matter because the message is the same.”</p>

			<p>According to Murphy, solely focusing on Mr. Trump misses the mark because he is a product of a male-dominated society. Rather than perform burlesque, Murphy suggests people think about Trump’s approach to women and connect it to the broader culture that has normalized so many harmful behaviors.</p>

			<p>“We should totally hate Trump, reject his ideas and mock him, but it’s not just about Trump," Murphy says. "Adding politics into a strip show doesn’t necessarily disrupt the idea of women being sexualized bodies or objects.”</p>

	 		<p>Regardless of whether or not burlesque has successfully eroded sexist culture, those who partake love what they do, embrace the confidence it gives them and hope their performances create change&#8212however small.</p>


			<p>“I enjoy being part of a woman-centric burlesque community that is striving toward inclusivity,” Freeman says. “I honestly hope [my piece] motivates more people, particularly men, to pay attention and realize that their actions reflect what [Mr. Trump] is saying, whether it’s intentional or not.”</p>
